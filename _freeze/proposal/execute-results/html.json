The poll actually resulted in two datsets: `polls` and `reputation`. The `polls` dataset has 8 variables and 500 rows or observations. This dataset has each company\\'s overall ranking and RQ score (a computed compilation of company attribute rankings ) as well as information from previous years. Next, the `reputation` dataset has 10 variables and 700 rows or observations. This dataset is only from the year 2022, and shows the individual breakdown for how companies were rated based on certain rating attributes.\n\nWe've interacted with many of these companies before, yet our familiarity with these entities is limited solely to their name recognition. In an effort to expand our knowledge and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their respective positions, we aim to delve deeply into the available data from the 2022 Axios-Harris Poll and draw deeper insights. We're interested in investigating companies across different industries that are highly reputable, but may have experienced either a decline or rise in the public's eye.Â \n\n# Questions\n\n1.  Which industry on average ranked the highest for each rating attribute in the year of 2022?\n\n2.  How does company RQ score change between the years of 2017 to 2022?\n\n# Analysis plan\n\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\nOur analysis of question 1 will come from the `reputation` dataset. To see which industry on average ranked the highest for each attribute in 2022, we will use the variables `name`, `industry`, and `rating`. We will have to wrangle the data before visualization by creating an average rating variable for each attribute for each industry. Also, we may re-categorize some of the industries or place some companies in different industries to have better categories for comparison in the visualization. For our visualization, we are going to segment it by the seven attributes and show which industry has the highest average score in each.\n\n1.
