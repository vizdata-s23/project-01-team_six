It contains information about the company's industry, company attribute scores, and overall RQ scores.\n-   By investigating differences in scores between industries, the relationship between attribute categories, and changes in company scores over time, we hope to achieve better insight on company reputations\n\n## Question 1: How do customer ratings of company attributes vary by industry and how do these attributes relate to one another?\n\n## Question 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-html/q1v1 plot-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-html/q1v2 plot-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2: How does company RQ score change between 2017-2022 and are the trends consistent with the overall industry?\n\n## Question 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.\nℹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?\n`geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.\nℹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-html/question 2 visualization 1-1.gif){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-html/question 2 vizualization 2-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Recap\n\n-   Company industry affects how consumers feel about companies.\n-   Consumers similarly rate a company across all attributes.\n-   Real-world events affected how consumers evaluated companies over time.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n-   Only have attribute data for 2022, so can't tell how companies' attribute ratings changed over time\n-   Visualizations don't necessarily depict the underlying reasons due to change in RQ score\n-   \n-   \n",
