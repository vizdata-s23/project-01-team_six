# Dataset

1.  How does company RQ score change between the years of 2017 to 2022 and are the trends consistent with their overall industry?

`poll` dataset. Variables involved include `company`, `rq`, `2022_rq`, and `year`.

-   Remove all companies for which there is an NA value for RQ score for any of these years.

-   Wrangle so `2022_rq` is in the same column as `rq`

-   Filter for the top 3 companies who had the greatest increase in RQ score and top 3 companies with the greatest decrease in RQ score from 2017-2022.

-   Next, we intend on created a progressive line chart to visualize their change over time, where each line represents a company. We will utilize the `gganimate` package with the `transition_reveal()` function set to yearly to demonstrate this, and include the `geom_point()` function grouping each company so for each year
