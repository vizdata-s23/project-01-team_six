## Abstract

Our project aims to investigate the different factors that contribute to customer perceptions of notable company reputations. We've interacted with many of these companies before, yet our familiarity with these entities is limited solely to their name recognition. In an effort to expand our knowledge and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their respective positions, we aim to delve deeply into the available data from the 2022 Axios-Harris Poll which contains information concerning company scores for specific attribute categories in 2022, as well as how these scores and overall rankings have changed over time. By investigating differences in scores between industries, the relationship between attribute categories, and changes in company scores over time, we hope to achieve better insight on the intricacies of what may influence company reputations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

The dataset that we are using comes from the TidyTuesday project that uses data from the Axis-Harris Poll, which investigated the reputation of the most visible brands in America. The Harris Poll conducted a survey in February 2022 among a representative sample of the American population to identify the companies that were most prominent in the public's mind. The top 100 companies with the highest number of nominations were included in the "Most Visible" list. The poll actually resulted in two datsets: \`polls\` and \`reputation\`. The polls dataset has 8 variables and 500 observations. This dataset has each company's industry, overall ranking, and RQ score in 2022 as well as information about each company's rating from 2017 to 2021. RQ scores are a metric that is a combination of each company's rating for each specific attribute. The attributes are: trust, ethics, growth, p&s, citizenship, vision, and culture. It is specifically calculated using the formula:  \[ (Sum of ratings of each of the 9 attributes)/(the total number of attributes answered x 7) \] x 100. Additionally, score ranges are: 80 & above: Excellent \| 75-79: Very Good \| 70-74: Good \| 65-69: Fair \| 55-64: Poor \| 50-54: Very Poor \| Below 50: Critical. Next, the reputation dataset has 10 variables and 700 rows or observations. This dataset is only from the year 2022, and shows the individual breakdown for how companies were scored and ranked based on the 7 attributes mentioned previously. This dataset is important for illustrating the specific attribute categories that different companies and their industries scored well or poorly on.

## Question 1: How do customer ratings of company attributes vary by industry and how do these attributes relate to one another? 

### Introduction

(1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you're interested in this question.

### Approach

(1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.

### Analysis

##### Visualization #1

```{r question 1 visualization 1}
reputation1 <- reputation |>
  group_by(industry, name) |>
  mutate(avg_score = mean(score))
reputation2 <- reputation1 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  mutate(maxavg = max(avg_score))

#used to confirm which industries were the highest scored in each category
overview <- reputation1 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  slice(which.max(avg_score))

#creating dataframes for each attribute based on which industry had the highest average
citizenship <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "CITIZENSHIP" & avg_score == maxavg)
culture <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "CULTURE" & avg_score == maxavg)
ethics <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "ETHICS" & avg_score == maxavg)
growth <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "GROWTH" & avg_score == maxavg)
ps <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "P&S" & avg_score == maxavg)
trust <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "TRUST" & avg_score == maxavg)
vision <- reputation2 |>
  group_by(name) |>
  filter(name == "VISION" & avg_score == maxavg)

final <- rbind(citizenship, culture, ethics, growth, ps, trust, vision)

#making visualization
get_box_stats <- function(y, upper_limit = max(final$score) * 1.15) {
  return(data.frame(
    y = 0.95 * upper_limit,
    label = paste(
      "Mean =", round(mean(y), 2), "\n",
      "Med =", round(median(y), 2), "\n"
    )
  ))
}
ggplot(final, aes(x = name, y = score, fill = industry)) +
  geom_boxplot(fatten = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Highest Rated Industries In Each Attribute Category", x = "Company Attribute", y = "Score", fill = "Industry") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#4ea5e3", "#ce0e5b", "#1aaf82")) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = get_box_stats, geom = "text", hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.9, size = 2.6) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

### Discussion

(1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.

## Question 2: How does company RQ score change between the years of 2017 to 2022 and are the trends consistent with their overall industry?

### Analysis

(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with **ggplot2**. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.
