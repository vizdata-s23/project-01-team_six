```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
poll <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-31/poll.csv') 
reputation <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-31/reputation.csv')
```

```{r}
view(poll)
```

Steps:
- Create summary of score variables to see which two attributes are highest on average
- Plot those two attributes

```{r}
average_attributes <- reputation %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(average_score = mean(score), .groups ="drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(average_score))

average_attributes

```

The two highest attributes are vision and growth, so we will compare those in the next visualization. 

```{r}
