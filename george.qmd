```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(viridis)
```

```{r}
poll <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-31/poll.csv') 
reputation <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-05-31/reputation.csv')
```

Steps:
- Create summary of score variables to see which two attributes are highest on average
- Plot those two attributes

```{r}
average_attributes <- reputation %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(average_score = mean(score), .groups ="drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(average_score))

average_attributes

```

The two highest attributes are vision and growth, so we will compare those in the next visualization. 

```{r}

reputation_v_g <- reputation %>%
  filter(name == "VISION" | name == "GROWTH") %>%
  select(company, name, score, industry)

reputation_v_g <- reputation_v_g %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = name,
    values_from = score
  )

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = reputation_v_g,
       aes(x = VISION, y = GROWTH)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = industry)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) + 
  geom_rug() +
#  geom_text_repel(aes(label = company)) + 
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    x = "Vision Attribute (out of 100)",
    y = "Growth Attribute (out of 100)",
    title = "Comparison of Companies' Vision and Growth Ratings",
    subtitle = "Vision and growth are strongly correlated"
  )
